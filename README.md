ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jordi Justicia, a software developer and game designer passionate about graphics programming, C++, and interactive storytelling.

ðŸŽ® I build games that blend history, technology, and immersive narrativesâ€”currently working on my thesis project exploring queer history through archaeology in games.

ðŸ’» I have experience in C++, Unity, Python, SQL, and graphics programming (Ray Tracing, Volume Rendering). I also love optimizing performance and working on game engines.

ðŸŒ± Always learning, always experimenting. Check out my projects below!
